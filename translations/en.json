Operational challenges such as developing effective outreach strategies, building partnerships with researchers, government, and industry, project management, and establishing sustainable funding models are central to our work.\n\nWe also invite citizen scientists and researchers from various fields as visiting fellows, promoting interdisciplinary research activities. Collaborating with experienced citizen science practitioners and experts in areas such as community management, science education, platform development, and gerontology, we explore the multifaceted potential of citizen science."
